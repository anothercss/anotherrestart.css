# anotherrestart.css

> anotherrestart.css is a css restart/reboot/reset/normalize whatever you want to call them.

It is built with [postcss](http://github.com/postcss/postcss) which allows us to be able to use new css features (like variables) and allows us to keep our src free from vendor prefixes through the use of [autoprefixer](http://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).
